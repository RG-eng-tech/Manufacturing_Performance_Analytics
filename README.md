# Manufacturing_Performance_Analytics
End-to-end manufacturing performance analysis using SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to track production efficiency, rejection rates, and operational KPI's.
# Manufacturing Performance Analytics & KPI Dashboard

# Project Overview
This project analyzes manufacturing operations to evaluate production efficiency, quality performance, and operational bottlenecks. Using SQL for data analysis and Power BI and Tableau for visualization, the project delivers actionable insights through interactive dashboards and KPIs.

The goal is to help stakeholders monitor manufacturing performance, reduce rejection and wastage, and improve decision-making using data-driven insights.

# Problem Statement
Manufacturing organizations often struggle with:
- High rejection and wastage rates
- Lack of visibility into department-wise performance
- Machine and employee inefficiencies
- Difficulty tracking production trends over time

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw manufacturing data into meaningful KPIs and dashboards.
